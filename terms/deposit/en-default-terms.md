======= 

## 1.	Short description of the service
In order to enter into a tenancy agreement with [landLord], you must create a deposit account (frozen account) with [landLord]’s bank connection Easybank, and deposit a given amount to the frozen bank account. You will be named the owner of this account, however the deposited amount that you pay will be frozen on the account until the tenancy ends and the account is to be settled. Any interest earned on the account will be credited to you. Account establishment, communication with the bank and settlement of the account are performed digitally. When your tenancy with [landLord] ends, you should contact [landLord] and request that the deposit account is terminated and settled. If [landLord] has not provided any financial claims towards you in regard to unpaid rent or other claims, [landLord] shall report to Easybank that the deposited funds on the account shall be released to you in its entirety. If there are claims and it is agreed that a certain amount should be credited to [landLord], you should contact [landLord] and make an agreement about which split that should happen when the deposit account is terminated and settled. When you have reached an agreement, both you and [landLord] will be requested to sign a document where the agreed split between you is described.
